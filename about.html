      <h1>My name is <span> Angelica Persson</span></h1>
      <h2>I'm a bit of a perfectionist with a problem solving mind.</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          As a person, I'm outgoing and like to explore new places. I'm eager to
          learn and am always teaching myself new skills. It can vary from
          teaching myself to cook new foods, learning new languages, or learning
          about a new occupation. Simply put, I just love to evolve and explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a bit of a perfectionist with a problem-solving mind. I'm always
          looking at things with the mindset that everything can be improved. As
          a person, I can be divided between my creative side which loves to
          create artwork, and new designs. And my other logical,
          problem-solving, physiologic-loving side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding out about UX-designer was finding a career that felt like
          home.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spend my free time with my husband, my 5-year-old son, and our
          respective families. When I'm not with family, I spend my time with
          friends or you can find me painting. As a UX designer, I strive to
          make simple, beautiful, and user-friendly experiences that make the
          digital world feel as comfortable as being at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's work together and create a new fun, digital, user-friendly era!
